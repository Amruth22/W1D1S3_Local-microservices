## Slide 2: Introduction to Microservices Architecture

### Understanding Modern Distributed System Design

**What are Microservices:**
- Architectural pattern that structures applications as loosely coupled services
- Each service is independently deployable and focuses on a specific business capability
- Services communicate through well-defined APIs and protocols
- Alternative to traditional monolithic application architecture

**Core Principles:**
- **Single Responsibility:** Each service handles one business domain
- **Decentralized:** Services manage their own data and business logic
- **Independent Deployment:** Services can be deployed and scaled independently
- **Technology Agnostic:** Different services can use different technologies

**Benefits of Microservices:**
- **Scalability:** Scale individual services based on demand
- **Flexibility:** Use different technologies for different services
- **Resilience:** Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Team Autonomy:** Different teams can work on different services independently

**Common Use Cases:**
- **E-commerce Platforms:** User service, product service, payment service
- **Social Media Applications:** Authentication, messaging, content management
- **Enterprise Systems:** Customer management, inventory, billing services
- **IoT Applications:** Device management, data processing, analytics services

## Slide 3: Microservices vs Monolithic Architecture

### Comparing Architectural Approaches

**Monolithic Architecture:**
- **Single Deployable Unit:** Entire application deployed as one package
- **Shared Database:** All components access the same database
- **Technology Stack:** Uniform technology across the application
- **Communication:** In-process method calls and shared memory

**Microservices Architecture:**
- **Multiple Services:** Application split into independent services
- **Service-Specific Databases:** Each service manages its own data
- **Technology Diversity:** Different services can use different technologies
- **Network Communication:** Services communicate over network protocols

**When to Choose Microservices:**
- **Large Teams:** Multiple teams working on different features
- **Complex Domains:** Application with distinct business capabilities
- **Scalability Requirements:** Different parts need different scaling strategies
- **Technology Diversity:** Need to use different technologies for different features

**When to Choose Monolith:**
- **Small Teams:** Single team managing the entire application
- **Simple Applications:** Straightforward business logic and requirements
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Quick development and deployment cycles
- **Limited Resources:** Constraints on infrastructure and operational complexity
